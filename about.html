				<h2>About Us!</h2>
					<p>Frozen was founded in 1999 by Moira Clark from Ottawa, Canada. It was a modest effort: a small store with an extraordinary product and a great design. A concept was developed that provided consumers a health experience unlike any they had tasted before. They immediately fell in love, and a strong following pursued.</p>
					<p>Today, Frozen has grown to be one of the highest ranked frozen yogurt companies world wide, with over 1000 locations operating in 30 countries around the world.</p>
					<p>Stay Frosty!</p>
